# Quarantine and testing strategies in contact tracing for SARS-CoV-2

The main script to run the analysis is `pcr_test_trace.R`. Set a name for your results in `results_name` and then run the rest of the script. Your results will be returned as a list of data frames for each scenario you have run (defined in `parameters.R`) and saved as a `.RDS` in `/results/"results_name"`.

Figures can be generated by running `plots.R` and in-text results can be generated by running `in_text.R`, after checking that your `results_name` is correct.
